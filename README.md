         C++ API for accessing the Yosokumo data mining web service

ŷosokumo was a data mining web service which allowed users to make
predictions about new individuals based on data supplied about previously
seen examples of similar individuals.  It offered quite sophisticated
prediction modeling of various kinds.  Click

specification of the web service, as well as Doxygen for the programmer
writing C++ code to access the service.

IMPORTANT:  The ŷosokumo project was abandoned, and hence any links to
